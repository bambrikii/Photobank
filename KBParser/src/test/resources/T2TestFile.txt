The Java Interface.

Writing the interface to get the ANTLR output is a little more complicated than earlier versions, but the result is more powerful. The basic glue to get things going has changed as well.
Software developers and language tool implementors can use ANTLR to implement Domain-Specific Languages, to generate parts of language compilers and translators, or even to help them build tools that parse complex XML.
